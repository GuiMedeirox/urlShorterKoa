 i am thinking about 4 **basic** functionalities: 

 1. short an URL;
 2. delete an URL; 
 3. redirect to URL by shortcode
 4. list all shortened URLS

 so I wanna implement: 
    auto-expirate logic of urls
    authentication to create custom short codes
    QRcode generation for URLS
    use rate limiting;
    use graceful shutdown;
    implement, in a stress test, load balance w/ hash consistance algorithm
